Flood Prediction Machine Learning Model

#Introduction: Natural disasters, such as floods, can have devastating impacts on communities, infrastructure, and the environment. 
In recent years, the state of Kerala in India has experienced significant challenges related to flooding during the monsoon season. 
Understanding and predicting these events are crucial for effective disaster management and preparedness. This project aims to contribute
to the efforts in Kerala flood prediction using a comprehensive dataset that includes various meteorological parameters.

#Problem Statement: Kerala, known for its monsoon rains, is prone to annual floods that cause significant damage to life and property. 
The goal of this project is to develop a robust predictive model for Kerala flood prediction using historical meteorological data .The dataset 
comprises information on rainfall in different months, annual rainfall, and a binary indicator for the occurrence of floods.
